Problem 1_1:
Write a function problem1_1() that prints "Problem Set 1". 

Tip: Be careful that your program outputs this exact phrase with no additional 
characters.  It will be graded automatically and must be precise.  Here is the
run of my solved problem 1_1:

problem1_1()
Problem Set 1

Note the problem1_1() is what I typed to run the problem and "Problem Set 1" is
what it printed out.  There will typically be a sample run such as this either 
before or after the statement of each problem. This helps clarify what you
are expected to do and shows how the auto-grader expects it to look.
