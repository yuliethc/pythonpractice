Problem 1_5:
Write a function 'problem1_5(age)'. This function should use if-elif-else
statement to print out "Have a glass of milk." for anyone under 7; "Have
a coke." for anyone under 21, and "Have a martini." for anyone 21 or older.

Tip: Be careful about the ages 7 (a seven year old is not under 7) and 21.
Also be careful to make the phrases exactly as shown for the auto-grader.
